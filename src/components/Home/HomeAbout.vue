            Merhaba, my name is <b>Derin Ã–nder Eren</b>! I'm a self-taught
            developer from Istanbul/Turkey. I'm currently a highschool student.
            I'm interested in every aspect of computer science, electronics,
            science and body building. To be honest, I'm a bit of a nerd. I love
            to learn new things and I'm always trying to improve myself. I like
            reading and watching about everything but my favorites are sci-fi,
            psychology, history and self-improvement. I'm currently working as a
            <i><u>Full-stack Web and Web3 developer intern</u></i> at
            <b>AymarTech</b>.
